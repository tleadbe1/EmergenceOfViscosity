This repository provides Python code for the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
algorithms and maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) described in the 
manuscript "Emergence of viscosity and dissipation via stochastic bonds"
which has been submitted to the Journal of the Mechanics and Physics
of Solids for publication. These files are intended to provide simple
working examples for other researcher interested in recreating and
expanding the results found in the manuscript. Comments have been 
provided here, but further explanations can be found in appendices
A and F of the manuscript itself. 


The files include in this repository are:

kmc.py 
--------------
This file provides code to preform force independent and force
dependent KMC simulation of the bonding and unbonding of a single bond
in the stochastic bond model.

--------------
--------------

kmcSolidBridge.py
--------------
This file provides the code for running a KMC simulation of the solid
bridge pull-off experiments described in Section 4.2 of the manuscript.

--------------
--------------

mle.py
--------------
This file provides the code for computing the MLE for the kinetic parameters
(the bonding and unbonding rate and the critical force) from experimental data
of the solid bridge pull-off experiment (see Section 4.2 and Appendix F of the 
manuscript)
